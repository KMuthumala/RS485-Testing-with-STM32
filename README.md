## Introduction

 RS-485 is a multipoint communications standard set by the Electronics Industry Alliance (EIA) and Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA). RS-485 supports several connection types, including DB-9 and DB-37. Because of lower impedance receivers and drivers, RS-485 supports more nodes per line than RS-422. RS-485 is also known as EIA-485 or TIA-485.

## Tools

### [STM32-Nucleo Development Boards](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32-nucleo-boards.html#:~:text=The%20highly%20affordable%20STM32%20Nucleo,prototypes%20with%20any%20STM32%20MCU.&text=The%20STM32%20Nucleo%20boards%20integrate,need%20for%20a%20separate%20probe.)
STM32 is a family of 32-bit microcontroller integrated circuits by STMicroelectronics. The STM32 chips are grouped into related series that are based around the same 32-bit ARM processor core, such as the Cortex-M33F, Cortex-M7F, Cortex-M4F, Cortex-M3, Cortex-M0+, or Cortex-M0. Internally, each microcontroller consists of the processor core, static RAM, flash memory, debugging interface, and various peripherals.
